    vpudec: support dynamic update input caps
    
    Although it does work, but it still have the same problem when
    suffer from the Android CTS, re-allocate buffers would be too
    slow causing Gstreamer base drops a few frames.
    
    We could use the same way in Android to avoid this problem,
    don't allocate max buffers (10 buffers) and use videorate to
    sync or just less buffers (8 buffers).

    vpudec: enabled hardware accelerated decoding using Rockchip's video processing solution
    
    This release includes developement of the hardware decoder
    plugin. It use the kernel vpu driver (drivers/misc/rockchip/vpu)
    and Rockchip's libvpu API's for decoding.
    
    Following are the features list added in this patch:
    
    1. Zero Copy: The decoder uses zero copy mechanism from source to sink.
    
    2. Multithreading Support: Created different threads for dequeueing
    decoded frames to improve performance and parallelize operation with
    downstream postprocessor element. For 1080p streams, fps > 50 fps
    is calculated.
    
    3. Multicodec Support: Enabled MPEG-2/4, VP8, H.264 and H.265 codecs.
    
    4. Pool: Enabled vpudecpool for buffer recycling and memory management.
    
    TODO:
    - Validate H.265 stream with dtsi modifications
